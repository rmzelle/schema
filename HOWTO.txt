How to make branched changes in github
======================================

(1) Insulate the main repo from our changes by forking the project on github.

(2) Create branches with git checkout -b dev_<NAME>

(3) Set up tracking to forked repo on github with git push origin -u dev_<NAME>

(4) Open branches with git checkout dev_<NAME>

(5) Make changes inside branch, commit and document with git commit -a

(6) Push branch changes to github with git push

(7) Get the MD5 name of a commit within a branch with:

       git checkout dev_<NAME>
       git log | more

    Cut and past the MD5 name.

(8) Open master with git checkout dev_master

(9) Merge commit to branch with git merge <MD5>

(10) Push change to github master

(11) If you put a foot wrong and things get tangled up, start all over.
